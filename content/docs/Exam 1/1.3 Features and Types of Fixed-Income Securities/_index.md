### What Are Fixed Income Securities?

Fixed-income securities represent debt of the entity that issues them. As such, you will often hear the term debt
securities to describe them. The terms of a fixed-income security include a promise by the issuer to repay the
maturity value, or principal, on the maturity date, and to pay interest either at stated intervals over the life of the
security or at maturity. In most cases, if the security is held to maturity, the rate of return is fairly certain. Interest
payments paid by issuers are taxed as ordinary income.
