# Canadian Securities Industry

## Types of Investment Dealers
*Investment dealers* (also called *brokers*) act as intermediaries by matching investors with the users of the capital. Each side of a transaction has its own dealer who matches the trades through the markets.

Investment dealers act on their clientsâ€™ behalf as agents in the transfer of financial instruments between different investors. They sometimes also act as principals, rather than agents. An agent, unlike a principal dealer, does not own the securities being traded.

### Retail Firms

*Retail firms* include full-service investment dealers and self-directed brokers (also known as discount brokers). Full-service retail firms offer a wide variety of products and services for the retail investor. They also provide various levels of advice, depending on the financial and wealth management concerns of their investor clients. Self-directed brokers, on the other hand, are considered the do-it-yourself approach to investing. They execute trades for clients at reduced rates, but they do not provide investment advice.

### Institutional Firms
*Institutional firms* are investment dealers that serve exclusively institutional clients, organizations that trade large volumes of securities. Institutional clients include pension funds and mutual funds, and may be domestic or foreign institutional firms. In Canada, foreign firms account for about one-third of all institutional clients. Foreign firms include affiliates of many of the major U.S. and European securities dealers.

### Integrated Firms
*Integrated firms* offer products and services across the industry and participate fully in both the retail and institutional markets. Most integrated firms underwrite all types of federal, provincial, and municipal debt, as well as corporate debt and equity issues. They are active in secondary markets, including the money market, as well as on all Canadian stock exchanges and some foreign exchanges. 

### Investment Boutiques
Many smaller retail or institutional investment dealers, known as *investment boutiques*, specialize in particular market segments. For example, an investment boutique might specialize in stock trading, bond trading, or trading strictly in unlisted stocks.
