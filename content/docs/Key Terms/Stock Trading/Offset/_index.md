# Stock Trading: What Is an Offset?

An offset is a financial market strategy that requires a trader to take an opening position and then take a directly opposite position.

The goal of offsetting is to reduce an investor's net position in an investment to zero so that no further gains or losses are experienced from that position.

An offset in futures trading is taking two opposite positions on a commodity to cancel the delivery of the commodity.
