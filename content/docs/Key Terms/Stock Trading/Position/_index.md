# Stock Trading: Position

## What Is a Position?

A position is the amount of a security, asset, or property that is either owned or sold short. A trader or investor takes a position when they make a purchase through a buy order, signaling bullish intent; or if they sell short securities with bearish intent.

Opening a new position is ultimately followed at some point in the future by exiting or closing the position.

- A position is established when a trader or investor executes a trade that does not offset an existing position.
- Open positions can be either long, short, or neutral in response to the direction of its price.
- Positions can be closed for either a profit or loss by taking the opposite position; for instance, selling shares that were purchased to open a long position.
- Positions may be closed voluntarily or involuntarilyâ€”as in the case of a forced liquidation or a bond that has reached maturity.
- Positions refer to the ownership of a security at a given time, so when an investor takes a position, it means they make a purchase or they sell.
- Positions are usually short-term and their purpose is to capitalise on market movements.

## What Is the Difference Between a Long and a Short Position?

Investors have a long position when they own security and keep it expecting that the stock will rise in value in the future. A short position, on the contrary, refers to the technique of selling security (which you don't own yet) with plans to buy it later, expecting that the price will fall in the short term.

Open positions can be long or short. Long positions involve owning a security before being sold; they profit when there is an increase in price. Short positions involve borrowing a security before being sold, to be bought back at a lower price: they profit when the security falls in price.
