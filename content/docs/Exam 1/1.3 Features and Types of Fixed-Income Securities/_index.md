## Fixed Income Marketplace

### What Are Fixed Income Securities?

Fixed income securities represent the debt of the organization that issues them. Thus, you will often hear the term "debt".
securities to describe them. The terms of a fixed income security include a promise by the issuer to repay
the value of the redemption or principal on the maturity date, and to pay interest at set intervals during the term
security or maturity. In most cases, if a security is held to maturity, the yield is fairly certain. Interest
payments made by issuers are taxed as ordinary income.

Trading in fixed income securities in today's markets is represented by many types, including bonds, debentures, cash
market instruments, mortgages and even preferred shares. Different types reflect a variety of borrowings needs and investor demands.
Issuers of fixed income securities may modify the terms of the underlying security to satisfy both
their needs and expenses, as well as to provide acceptable conditions for various creditors.

## Bonds
A bond is a long-term, fixed-obligation debt security that is secured by physical assets—such as a building or a
railway car—owned by the issuing company.

Bonds are considered fixed-income securities because they impose fixed financial obligations on issuers—that is, the
payment of regular interest payments and the return of principal on the date of maturity. The details of a bond issue
are outlined in a legal document called the trust deed and written into a bond contract. If the issuer can no longer
meet the fixed obligations, the bond goes into default. When that happens, the provisions of the trust deed allow
the bondholders to seize specified physical assets and sell them to recover their investment.

#### Debentures, or unsecured bonds
A debenture is a type of bond that is secured by something other than a specified physical asset, typically by a
general claim on residual assets. Therefore, the debenture is backed by the general creditworthiness of the issuer.
For this reason, debentures are also referred to as unsecured bonds. Aside from this difference, debentures are similar
to bonds, and as such, they promise the payment of regular interest and the repayment of principal at maturity.

For example, government bonds are never secured by physical assets, and so technically
they are debentures; in practice, however, they are always referred to as bonds.

### Par Value
The par value of a bond (also called face value) is the principal amount the
bond issuer contracts to pay at maturity to the bondholder. A bond is issued and
matures at its par value.

### Coupon rate
The coupon rate, or simply the coupon, is the interest or rate paid by the bond
issuer relative to the bond’s par or face value over the term of the bond.
The coupon represents the regular interest the bond issuer is obliged to pay to the bondholders.
Most bonds are coupon bonds, paying fixed coupon rates. 
Most bonds make semi-annual coupon payments; some bonds pay coupons on an annual basis.

The coupon rate is set at the time of issue and typically does not change over the
term of the bond.
The bondholders receive a fixed-income stream of payments based on that coupon rate. 

The amount of interest at each
payment date is equal to the coupon rate divided by the number of payments per year.

### Maturity date
The maturity date is the date at which a bond matures, when the principal
amount of the loan is paid back to the investor holding the bond. Upon maturity,
the final interest payment is also made.

### Term to maturity
The term to maturity is the time that remains before a bond matures.

### Bond price
The bond price is the present discounted value of all the future payments that the
bond issuer is obligated to pay the investor.

Once a bond is issued, it can trade at a value that is equal to, above, or below its
par value depending on the direction of market interest rates.

#### Bond price index
The price of a bond is quoted using an index with a base value of 100. For example,
$1,000 par value with a price quoted at 97 refers to a price of $97 for each $100 of
face value. Since there are 10 units of $100 face value in a $1,000 bond, the price
of a bond with a $1,000 face value and a price quote of 97 would be $970.

### Yield to maturity
The yield to maturity is the annual return on a bond that is held to maturity.

### Bonds Denominations
Bonds can be purchased only in specific denominations. Normally, an issue designed for a broad retail market
is issued in smaller denominations, the most common being $1,000 and $10,000. Larger denominations may
be issued to suit the preference of investing institutions, such as banks and life insurance companies. These
denominations may be worth millions of dollars.

### Bond Pricing
A bond trading at a quoted price of 100 is said to be trading at par (i.e., at face value). A bond trading below par - at
a price of 93, for example - s said to be trading at a **discount** (i.e., based on the index of 100, the bond is trading at
93% of face value). A bond trading above par - at a price of 107, for example - is said to be trading at a **premium**.
Market interest rates, relative to the coupon on a bond, are a key determinant of the price of a bond.

### Bond Yields
A bond yield represents the amount of return on the bond.

There are several types of yields, including yield to maturity. The interest income that you earn
on a bond divided by its face value is another type of yield. We can also determine the current yield on a bond
by dividing the coupon income by the current market price. 

While the coupon income on a bond stays constant over its term, yield and price fluctuate day to day.
