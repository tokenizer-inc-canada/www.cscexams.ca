# Stock Trading: What Is a Position?

A position is the amount of a security, asset, or property that is either owned or sold short. A trader or investor takes a position when they make a purchase through a buy order, signaling bullish intent; or if they sell short securities with bearish intent.

Opening a new position is ultimately followed at some point in the future by exiting or closing the position.

- A position is established when a trader or investor executes a trade that does not offset an existing position.
- Open positions can be either long, short, or neutral in response to the direction of its price.
- Positions can be closed for either a profit or loss by taking the opposite position; for instance, selling shares that were purchased to open a long position.
- Positions may be closed voluntarily or involuntarilyâ€”as in the case of a forced liquidation or a bond that has reached maturity.
