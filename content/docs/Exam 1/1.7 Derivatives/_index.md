# 1.7 Derivatives

## Role of Derivatives
> Explain the differences between over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives.

A derivative is a financial contract between two parties whose value is derived from, or dependent on, the value
of an underlying asset. The underlying asset can be a financial asset (such as a stock or bond), a currency, a
futures contract, an index, or even an interest rate. It can also be a real asset or commodity, such as crude oil, gold,
or wheat.



## Types of Underlying Assets
> Identify the types of underlying assets on which derivatives are based.

### Commodities

### Financial Assets

#### Equities
- options on individual stocks.

These derivatives are traded mainly on organized exchanges such as the Montréal Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the International Securities Exchange, the Boston Options Exchange, the NYSE AMEX Options, and the NYSE ARCA Options markets.

#### Interest Rates
- generally based on interest rate sensitive securities rather than on interest rates directly.
- In Canada, underlying assets include bankers’ acceptances and Government of Canada bonds.
- All interest rate futures trading in Canada takes place at the Montréal Exchange.

#### Currencies
- U.S. dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and European euro
- include currency futures and options on organized exchanges, and currency forwards and currency swaps in the OTC market.

different prices in two separate markets.

- An option is a contract giving the buyer the right—but not the obligation—to buy (in the case of a call) or sell (in the case of a put) the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.
- People use options for income, to speculate, and to hedge risk.
- Options are known as derivatives because they derive their value from an underlying asset.
- A stock option contract typically represents 100 shares of the underlying stock, but options may be written on any sort of underlying asset from bonds to currencies to commodities.


An option is a contract between two parties: a buyer (known as the **long position** or holder) and a seller (known as the **short position** or the writer).

An option that gives its holder the right to **buy**, and the seller the obligation to **sell**, the underlying asset is known as a **call option**.

An option that gives its holder the right to **sell**, and its writer the obligation to buy, the underlying
asset is referred to as a put option.


## Forwards and Futures
> Distinguish between forwards and futures contracts and the strategies used by market participants.

## Rights and Warrants
> Distinguish between the features, benefits, and intrinsic value of rights and warrants.


## Glossary

### American-style option

An American-style option, aka an American option, is a version of an options contract that allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. It contrasts with another type of option, called the European option, that only allows execution on the day of expiration. All exchange-traded stock options in North America are American-style options.

### Arbitrage
- Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in different markets to exploit tiny differences in their prices.
- Arbitrage trades are made in stocks, commodities, and currencies.
- Arbitrage takes advantage of the inevitable inefficiencies in markets.
- By exploiting market inefficiencies, however, the act of arbitraging brings markets closer to efficiency.

Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same or similar asset in different markets in order to profit from tiny differences in the asset’s listed price. It exploits short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms.

An arbitrage opportunity refers to a scenario where the same asset or commodity is traded at
different prices in two separate markets. By purchasing low in one market and selling high in the
other market simultaneously, an investor locks in a fixed amount of profit at no risk.

For example, suppose an arbitrageur spots an exploitable market mispricing and attempts to
profit by buying in the cheap market and selling in the rich market. If the two transactions are
executed simultaneously, or nearly simultaneously, then there is no investment or risk involved
in the arbitrage.

Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies, and it both exploits those inefficiencies and resolves them.

### Swaps
A swap is a private, contractual agreement between two parties used to exchange (swap) periodic
payments in the future based on an agreed to formula. Swaps are essentially equivalent to a series of
forward contracts packaged together.
