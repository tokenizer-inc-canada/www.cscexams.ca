It represents the total value of the company’s assets that shareholders would theoretically receive if a company were liquidated. Also represents the original cost of the units allocated to a segregated fund contract.

corporation
: A form of business organization created under provincial or federal statutes which has a legal identity separate from its owners. The corporation’s owners (shareholders) have no personal liability for its debts. See also Limited Liability.

declining-balance method

depletion

Producing oil, mining and gas companies deal in products that cannot be replenished and as such are known as wasting assets. The recording of depletion is a bookkeeping entry similar to depreciation and does not involve the expenditure of cash.
