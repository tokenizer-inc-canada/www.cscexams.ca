## What Is Out of the Money (OTM)?



## Terminology

[Extrinsic Value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extrinsicvalue.asp)
: Extrinsic value measures the difference between the market price of an option, called the premium, and its intrinsic value

[Intrinsic Value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp)
: Intrinsic value is a measure of what an asset is worth. This measure is arrived at by means of an objective calculation or complex financial model. Intrinsic value is different from the current market price of an asset.  In options trading, intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price of the option and the current market price of the underlying asset.

[Out of the Money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp)
: "Out of the money" (OTM) is an expression used to describe an option contract that only contains extrinsic value. An OTM call option will have a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset. Alternatively, an OTM put option has a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset.
