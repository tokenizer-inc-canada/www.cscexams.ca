# Derivatives: What Is a Naked Option?

Naked Option
: An investing term that refers to an investor selling an option without holding a corresponding position in the option’s underlying security

- A naked option exists when the option seller does not hold a corresponding position in the option’s underlying security.
- The alternative to a naked option is a covered option. A covered option is an option sold by a seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying security. It negates the risk of selling the option but limits the seller’s potential profit in the underlying security.
- Selling naked options is considered a high-risk trading strategy.
