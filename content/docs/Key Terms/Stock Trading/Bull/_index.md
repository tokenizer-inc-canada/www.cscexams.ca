# Stock Trading: What is a Bull?

Bulls are optimistic investors who are attempting to profit from the upward movement of stocks, with certain strategies suited to that theory. "BNulls" purchase securities under the assumption that they can sell them later at a higher price.

- A bull believes that the market will increase in value over time.
- Bears are the opposite of bulls; they believe that the general direction of prices in the market trends toward a decline.
- A bullish investor can fall prey to a bull trap, when they believe a sudden increase in the value of particular security is the beginning of a trend, resulting in the investor going long.
