Canadian Regulatory Environment



#### Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA)

[Mutual Funds Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA)](https://mfda.ca/) is an example of the *mutual fund industry SRO*, having 85 members, and 77,491 of licenced advisors (see current numbers at [MFDA Membership Statistics](https://mfda.ca/members/membership-statistics/))

The MFDA is responsible for regulating the distribution and sales of mutual funds by its members in Canada. The MFDA does not regulate the mutual funds themselves; this responsibility remains with the provincial securities administrators. The MFDA has the ability to admit members, audit, enforce rules, and apply penalties.

#### Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF)
In Quebec, the mutual fund industry is regulated by the [Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF)](https://lautorite.qc.ca/grand-public). 

An agreement has been signed between the AMF and the MFDA to avoid regulatory duplication for mutual fund firms operating both in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. The Chambre de la sécurité financière (CSF) is Quebec’s SRO of the mutual fund and insurance industry. The CSF is responsible for setting and monitoring continuing education requirements and for enforcing a code of ethics for licensed representatives.
