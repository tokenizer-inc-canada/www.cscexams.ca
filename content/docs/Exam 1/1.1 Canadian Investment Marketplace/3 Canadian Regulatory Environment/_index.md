# Canadian Regulatory Environment



#### Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA)

[Mutual Funds Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA)](https://mfda.ca/) is an example of the *mutual fund industry SRO*, having 85 members, and 77,491 of licenced advisors (see current numbers at [MFDA Membership Statistics](https://mfda.ca/members/membership-statistics/))

The MFDA is responsible for regulating the distribution and sales of mutual funds by its members in Canada. The MFDA does not regulate the mutual funds themselves; this responsibility remains with the provincial securities administrators. The MFDA has the ability to admit members, audit, enforce rules, and apply penalties.

#### Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF)
In Quebec, the mutual fund industry is regulated by the [Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF)](https://lautorite.qc.ca/grand-public). 

An agreement has been signed between the AMF and the MFDA to avoid regulatory duplication for mutual fund firms operating both in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. The Chambre de la sécurité financière (CSF) is Quebec’s SRO of the mutual fund and insurance industry. The CSF is responsible for setting and monitoring continuing education requirements and for enforcing a code of ethics for licensed representatives.

### Investor Protection Funds

#### MFDA IPC, CIPF

The Mutual Fund Dealers Association Investor Protection Corporation (MFDA IPC) was created in 2005 to provide protection for eligible customers of insolvent MFDA member firms. The IPC does not cover customers’ losses that result from changing market values, unsuitable investments, or the default of an issuer of securities.

As of January 1, 2023, the former Canadian Investor Protection Fund (Former CIPF) and the MFDA Investor Protection Corporation (MFDA IPC) were amalgamated to form a new investor protection fund: [the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF)/Fonds canadien de protection des investisseurs (FCPI)](https://www.cipf.ca/).

Following the structure of the CIPF, customer accounts are covered either as part of a general account or as a separate account. Each account is eligible for up to $1 million in coverage.

The MFDA is not recognized as a self-regulatory organization in the province of Quebec. Consequently, the MFDA IPC coverage is not currently available to customers with accounts held in Quebec. The province of Quebec has its own compensation fund.
